# DSA210-Term-Project

**Project Overview**

I am a Computer Science student from Sabanci University, and this is my Data Science Term Project. During the term, I am planning to analyse the relationship between Space Debris and the global leadership competition among various countries. 

During the project this hypothesis will be tested:

-	The global leadership race contributes to Space Debris. 


**Objectives**

1-	**Understanding which Countries are Competing for Global Leadership**

The Global Leadership race involves several key nations that draw attention because of their crucial technological, economic and military capabilities. 

2-	**Understanding which Countries are Contributing to Space Debris**

With the increasing number of satellite launches and space missions, Space Debris has become a significant problem. Furthermore, despite the fact that private companies started to engage in space missions, countries still have the largest share of Space Debris. 

3-	**Applying Data Science Skills**

Utilize the data science skills acquired in the DSA 210 course to implement real-world applications, which will deepen my knowledge of data analysis and visualization.


**Motivation**

**1-	Personal Curiosity**

I am interested in space and in the future, I want to work on this area.

**2-	An Area that Needs Attention**

Space Debris has become a crucial problem that is difficult to solve. Also, when it is compared with other areas related to space, it seems that there are low number of research. 

**3-	The Long Term Impact**

Finding will prove not only the relationship between Space Debris and global leadership but also pushing everyone to think on the solution. 

**4-	Scientific Approach**

Data which are going to be taken from reliable sources will help to evaluate the project reliably and scientifically.  

**Dataset**

The dataset of this project consists of several records.
-	Space Debris Share
-	GDP and Economic Growth
-	Military Spending and Capabilities
-	Technological Innovation
-	Political Influence
-	Trade Statistics
-	Investments in Infrastructure and Development Projects
-	Participation in International Organizations
-	Educational Influence


**Tools and Technologies**

Following tools and technologies will be used during the project. 

-	Python
-	Pandas
-	NumPy

**Analysis Plan**

**1.	Data Collection**

Import several records into a Pandas DataFrame and preprocess the data by handling missing values.

**2.	Visualization**

Use scatter plots, heatmaps, and time series plots to explore relationships between variables.

**3.	Testing Hypothesis**

The hypothesis testing will be structured as follows:

H0: The global leadership race does not contribute to Space Debris. 

H1: The global leadership race contributes to Space Debris. 

**Conclusion**

At the end of the project, I expect to answer the following questions:

-	Which countries are in the Global Leadership Race?
-	Which countries contributes to the Space Debris?
-	Is there any relationship between the Space Debris and Global Leadership Race?
